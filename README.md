FLAIR learns action priors from optical flow during training and predicts those priors from text to guide surgical video generation. Only a text prompt is required at inference.

**Code — released soon.** This repository currently contains the project website, not the research implementation.

## Website

Static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, deployed by GitHub Pages from the root of `main`. No build step is needed. To preview locally, serve this directory with any static web server.

- `index.html`: project content, publication metadata, and citation.
- `styles.css`: responsive layout.
- `script.js`: independent controls for all three visible animations, global play/pause, and citation copy.
- `assets/`: original supplied GIF comparisons, static preview frames, and figures extracted from the paper.
- `citation.bib`: downloadable BibTeX.

Figures correspond to Figures 1–4 and Table 1 of arXiv:2610.09800v1. FVD percentages are reductions relative to each backbone's LoRA-only baseline in Table 1. The three GIF comparisons are the author-provided demonstrations, copied without modification. All three appear in a large vertical gallery and play automatically. Static previews respect reduced-motion preferences. Each comparison can be paused independently or all at once. A short motivation introduces the gallery, followed by quantitative results before the method overview.

The visual layout is inspired by [Follow-Your-Click](https://follow-your-click.github.io/): centered paper information, blue text links, white panels, and an open comparison gallery. The page includes publication metadata, canonical URLs, a sitemap, and structured research metadata for discoverability; these do not guarantee search-engine indexing or rankings.
